I had the opportunity to talk with the Chicago Python community about how NuMat uses python to automate everything from our R&D to our business management.

Thanks to everyone for the feedback and conversation. The amazing python community is what got me hooked on the language [back in 2012]({% post_url 2012-04-08-pycon-2012 %}) and it's continued to drive my passion for software development.
