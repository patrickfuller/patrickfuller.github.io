Are you looking to hire me into your company? First, thanks for thinking of me. As someone who's sat many times on the other side of the table, I know how hard it is to find people. I'm genuinely flattered.

**To be up front, I'm not available for a full-time role.** If you're a recruiter looking to place me, I'm once again flattered but don't want to waste your time.

That said, I'm easily [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) and I'd love to learn about what you're up to. There may even be ways I could help you out!

## What I Can Offer

I'm often approached about 1. experience starting a "deep tech" company, 2. coding, and 3. management/fundraising. I've been able to help out teams through a few approaches.

### Talks

I've given talks to incubators, national labs, and universities on starting a deep tech company, with topics ranging from founding team dynamics (never undervalue the skills you don't have!) to making sure you're hiring the right people (avoid hiring inferiors to minimize dilution!). I've also spoken on reproducibility in scientific software development and recently talked through NuMat's software development work at a Chicago Python meetup.

If you'd like me to give a talk, please reach out. In most cases, I'm happy to present for free. My one request - if you want me to present a specific topic, please give me a few weeks of buffer to write something up.

### Classes

I've hosted workshops and given guest lectures on entrepreneurship and coding. I've found immersive multi-day workshops to be a very effective approach for teaching people how to code.<span title="I have a soft spot for teaching mid-career administrators enough code for them to solve their own problems. I believe that every professional should be able to make a simple throwaway script, if only to be aware of what their computer is capable of.">ⓘ</span> I've received great reviews on my guest lectures on entrepreneurship but am fairly skeptical of the format.<span title="I've found most startup advice to be either too broad to be actionable or too specific to be relevant. It's tough to balance but I think the best way to teach the topic is to collect and answer specific questions from early-stage startup incubators.">ⓘ</span>

Either way, I respect anyone trying to teach a new skill to a class. If I can help, please let me know and we can talk strategy.

### Mentorship

I've mentored "deep tech" companies in venture portfolios, national lab incubators, and universities. My approach is simple: I want to help you out by sharing my experience and providing advice. Commercializing science is hard and much of the information out there is still word of mouth. Because it's all word of mouth, the industry is filled with mentors with high price tags who trade on information. I hope this deep tech quirk will be worked out with the next generation of books and blog posts. Until then, I want to help bridge the gap. If the advice you need is less than an hour a month (and it often is), let me know and I'm happy to talk for free. I only ask that you help keep the talk structured.

I've also mentored high-performing high school students and people looking to transition to software development. I'm happy to help for free but I request we work through an organization such as ChiPy.

### Paid Work

I often help for free, but it comes with the caveat that my free work is the first thing to drop off when I get too busy. I recognize this and can provide an option for larger organizations. If you have a project that's too important to drift, let's discuss a statement of work.

## What I'm Looking For

### Philosophically

I am in an incredibly fortunate position to be right at the top of [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs#/media/File:Maslow's_Hierarchy_of_Needs2.svg). Especially as someone with a challenging upbringing, I recognize the privilege that has come from top-tier universities and my preparation-meets-opportunity career luck to date.

With this background, my goal is fulfillment. Fulfillment is a function of not only the work you're doing, but also the people around you, the mission you're aligned to, and the prioritization of your health.

I find constantly reviewing the question "what would you do if you didn't have to work?" to be a great form of holistic self reflection. My answers always involve doubling down on what I call "rewarding addictions" which invariably include 1. working and 2. staying in shape.

### Practically

* I need to be useful.<span title="This sounds simple but is difficult in practice. People with my background often end up on committees/boards with lots of vague prestige but no firm goals. These are draining.">ⓘ</span>
* I prefer to work toward solving important challenges, particularly in personal health and clean energy.
* I enjoy fixing things that are broken, be they technical or organizational. I also like building physical products.
* I love to code (particularly Python) and will find a way to use it in anything I do.
* I'm going to live in Chicago and/or Boston.
