Are you looking to hire me into your company? First, thanks for thinking of me. As someone who's sat many times on the other side of the table, I know how hard it is to find people. I'm genuinely flattered.

**To be up front, I'm not available for a full-time role.** If you're a recruiter looking to place me, I'm once again flattered but don't want to waste your time.

That said, I'm easily [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) and I'd love to learn about what you're up to. There may even be ways I could help you out!

## What I Can Offer

I'm often approached about 1. experience starting a "deep tech" company, 2. coding, and 3. management/fundraising. I've been able to help out teams through a few approaches.

### Talks

I've given talks to incubators, national labs, and universities on starting a deep tech company, with topics ranging from founding team dynamics<span title="Never undervalue the skills you don't have!">ⓘ</span> to making sure you're hiring the right people<span title="Avoid hiring inferiors to minimize dilution!">ⓘ</span>. I've also spoken on reproducibility in scientific software development and recently talked through NuMat's software development work at a Chicago Python meetup.

If you'd like me to give a talk, please reach out. In most cases, I'm happy to present for free. My one request - if you want me to present a specific topic, please give me a few weeks of buffer to write something up.

### Classes

I've hosted workshops and given guest lectures on entrepreneurship and coding. I've found immersive multi-day workshops to be a very effective approach for teaching people how to code.<span title="I have a soft spot for teaching mid-career administrators enough code for them to solve their own problems. I believe that every professional should be able to make a simple throwaway script, if only to be aware of what their computer is capable of.">ⓘ</span> I've received great reviews on my guest lectures on entrepreneurship but am fairly skeptical of the format.<span title="I've found most startup advice to be either too broad to be actionable or too specific to be relevant. It's tough to balance but I think the best way to teach the topic is to collect and answer questions from early-stage startup incubators.">ⓘ</span>

Either way, I respect anyone trying to teach a new skill to a class. If I can help, please let me know and we can talk strategy.

### Mentorship

I've mentored "deep tech" companies in venture portfolios, national lab incubators, and universities. My approach is simple: I want to help you out by sharing my experience and providing advice. Commercializing science is hard and much of the information out there is still word of mouth. Because of this, the industry is filled with mentors with high price tags who trade on information. I hope this deep tech quirk will be worked out with the next generation of books and blog posts. Until then, I want to help bridge the gap. If the advice you need is less than an hour a month (and it often is), let me know and I'm happy to talk for free. I only ask that you help keep the talk structured.

I've also mentored high-performing high school students and people looking to transition to software development. I'm happy to help for free but I request we work through an organization such as ChiPy.

### Paid Work

I often help for free, but it comes with the caveat that my free work is the first thing to drop off when I get too busy. I recognize this. If you have a project that's too important to drift, let's discuss a statement of work.

## What I'm Looking For

Being intentional is hard.<span title="When hiring, I like giving 'A or B' questions to candidates. Almost everyone replies 'A and B' and then waits nervously to see if there was a right answer. This is not an issue with the candidates but rather our broader system. We'll lie about our interests to get accepted to jobs that don't fulfill us.">ⓘ</span> This is my attempt to be transparent about my goals and rationale.

### Philosophically

I am in an incredibly fortunate position to be near the top of [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs#/media/File:Maslow's_Hierarchy_of_Needs2.svg). Especially as someone with a challenging upbringing, I recognize the privilege that has come from top-tier universities and my preparation-meets-opportunity career luck to date.

With this background, my goal is fulfillment. Fulfillment is a function of not only the work you're doing, but also the people around you, the mission you're aligned to, and the prioritization of your health.

I find constantly reviewing the question "what would you do if you didn't have to work?" to be a great form of holistic self reflection. My answers always involve doubling down on what I call "rewarding<span title="My college rowing coach broke life into 'fun' and 'rewarding'. Fun fulfills initially but dulls over time. Reward is hard initially but fulfills over time. Fulfillment comes from being intentional about how you split your fun vs. rewarding 'portfolio'.">ⓘ</span> addictions<span title="This came from a SciPy talk back in 2012. The comment was 'Coding is not a passion. It's an addiction.' It's a constant cycle of frustration followed by a small dopamine hit. I've found this pattern to hold true for my favorite activities.">ⓘ</span>". My answers invariably involve 1. making time for family and friends, 2. working hard on things that excite me, and 3. hitting the gym. Cooking, airplanes, dogs, and a sweet workshop also find their way in from time to time.

### Practically

What does this mean for me today?

* I need to be useful.<span title="This sounds simple but is difficult in practice. People with my background often end up on committees/boards with lots of vague prestige but no firm goals. These are draining.">ⓘ</span>
* I prefer to work toward solving challenges I feel are important, particularly in personal health and energy efficiency.
* I enjoy fixing things that are broken, be they technical or organizational.
* I love to code (particularly Python) and will find a way to use it in anything I do.
* I'm going to live in Chicago<span title="I'm on year 12 of what was supposed to be a 4-year stint before moving back east. Chicago is an amazing city.">ⓘ</span> and/or Boston<span title="I'm a native Rhode Islander with a major soft spot for the Boston area. I have family and friends in the area, and I've been increasingly splitting my time between both cities.">ⓘ</span>.
