My good friend [Chris Wilmer](https://wilmerlab.github.io/) collaborated with [Conrad Barski](https://www.lisperati.com/) (the author of [Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/)!) to write, animate, and publish [Bitcoin for the Befuddled](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Befuddled-Conrad-Barski-ebook/dp/B00PYXN5N2). I was able to help by contributing chapters on programming C, Python, and Javascript applications that work with Bitcoin transactions.

Conrad did a truly fantastic job with the animations and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to learn about this new technology. 

###### 29 Nov 2021 Update - Of course I wrote these tutorials in 2013 Javascript and now regret the limitations of paperback books.
