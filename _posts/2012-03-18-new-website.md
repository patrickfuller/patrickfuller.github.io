After pressure from a few people, I decided to take some time to create a blog-based
website for myself. I have a few goals here. Primarily, I am hoping to contribute
to the growing amount of e-literature on programming and coding issues. As a
computational chemical engineer, I find myself encountering poorly documented problems,
like, all the time. I am hoping to fix that to some small extent.

For those of you who stumble across this blog, I hope it helps.
