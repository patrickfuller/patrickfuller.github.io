I'm a founding employee of [NuMat Technologies](http://numat-tech.com/),
a chemical startup focused on bringing advanced adsorbent technology to market.
I personally work on grant management, intellectual property generation,
manufacturing development (process scale-up, automation, quality),
and research support.

I received my M.S. in Chemical Engineering from Northwestern, and B.S. degrees
in Chemical Engineering and Finance from Lehigh. I've authored [patents and
publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tGjfnfEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao),
as well as [open-source libraries](https://github.com/patrickfuller).
