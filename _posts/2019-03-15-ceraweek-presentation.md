I was honored to present at [CERAWeek 2019](https://ceraweek.com/about/ceraweek-2019.html) (presentation [here](https://ondemand.ceraweek.com/detail/video/6020822535001/next-generation-separation-purification-and-catalyst-technologies)), a massive executive conference about the future of global energy. The conference was an amazing experience, a great opportunity to meet with large-company executives and statesmen, and generally an opportunity to get out of my comfort zone.

That said, I do not like how I did in this presentation. At all. I'm posting it here because it's something I want to get better at. Reflection is the only way to do this.
