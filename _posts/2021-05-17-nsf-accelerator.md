I was honored to participate in *Accelerating Translational Materials R&D for Global Challenges*, an NSF Convergence Accelerator workshop hosted by IBM Research. This conference focused on guiding government funding and policy to accelerate high-impact projects within computational materials research.

This gave me an opportunity to highlight my views on data sharing, reproducibility, inclusivity, and incentives to the broader community. There is a lot of systemic work to be done but I'm very happy to see that the NSF is working with the community to create a real action plan.
