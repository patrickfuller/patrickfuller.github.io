I was humbled to be profiled by the [2015 Illinois Clean Jobs Report](https://web.archive.org/web/20150908153555/http://www.cleanjobsillinois.com/2015/) and the [Clean Energy Trust](https://www.builtinchicago.org/2015/04/15/northwestern-born-startups-score-half-available-funding-clean-energy-challenge) for our team's work on advancing cleantech in Chicago. We have a long way to go but we're hopefully showing others that it's possible.

I'd also like to add that clean tech is very much a team sport. No one skillset and no one technology can get us to the finish line. Let's continue to work together on advancing critical environmental technologies.
