I'm a founding team member of [NuMat Technologies](http://numat-tech.com/), a deep tech startup using custom-designed nanomaterials to filter toxic environmental pollutants out of air, water, and fuels.

I have an M.S. in chemical engineering from Northwestern University and B.S. degrees in chemical engineering and finance from Lehigh University. I have authored [patents, academic publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tGjfnfEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and [open-source libraries](https://github.com/patrickfuller).

Please [email me](mailto:patrickfuller@gmail.com) to continue the conversation.
